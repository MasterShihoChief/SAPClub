    <p>It’s time for a major upgrade!</p>

    <p>Ever thought Glenn Hall needed a coffee shop? Want a stream running through the building? Do you think you can design a more effective classroom or lab?</p>

    <p>In the near future, Glenn Hall is going to be torn down and rebuilt. The design competition is a way for students within the business organizations to leave their mark on Chico State. From the classrooms and labs, to the look of the building itself, the students have the power. Students will have free reign to create designs and imagine new ways for the business building to look and function.</p>

    <p>The new building is going to be here for a while, so think to the future and have your designs be adaptable to future technologies and teaching styles. For example, we may no longer have computers in classrooms, as classes may be set up for BYOD (bring your own device).</p>
